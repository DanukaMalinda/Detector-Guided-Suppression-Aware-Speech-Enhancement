# Detector-Guided-Suppression-Aware-Speech-Enhancement
This repository presents a transformer-based method for a target-speaker over-suppression detector and a detector-guided training framework for suppression-aware speech enhancement. The detector is evaluated against different types of modeled-over- suppression scenarios and suppression instances generated by speech enhancement models.
